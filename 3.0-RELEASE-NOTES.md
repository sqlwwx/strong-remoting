## Invocation for remote method has been changed.

We are deprecating the `SharedClass.prototype.find` and
`SharedClass.prototype.disableMethod` for looking up and disabling remote
methods in 3.0. They will be replaced by `SharedClass.prototype.findMethodByName`
and `SharedClass.prototype.disableMethodByName` where you can pass in a static
method or a prototype method name. These new methods will accept a string in the
form of "name" for a static method and "prototype.name" for a prototype method.

To find a static remote method:
`findMethodByName('create')`

To find a prototype remote method:
`findMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

To disable a static remote method
`disableMethodByName('create')`

To disable a prototype remote method:
`disableMethodByName('prototype.updateAttributes')`

## Using new error-handler for rest-adapter
- no longer support `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';`
- default message will be gone in returned as
  `Internal server error` instead eg ( `throw new Error('Username not found')` );
